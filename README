   The Mixxeo is the first open source digital video mixer.

[> Intro
--------
Built on the MiSoC and Migen technologies that originated from the development
experience of the Milkymist One and unlike other mixers, the Mixxeo itself does
everything and processes every pixel with our own open source hardware and
software. This gives us exceptional control and customization possibilities.

The Mixxeo will support mixing from two DVI or HDMI sources up to 720p60, with
crossfade, fade to black and potentially other effects with a latency of less
than two frames.

[> Quick start guide
--------------------
1. Follow MiSoC Quick start guide
	https://github.com/m-labs/misoc

2. Build the Mixxeo gateware and software:
	go to misoc dir
	./make.py -X your_mixxeo_path -t mixxeo all

[> Status:
----------
(Aug 2014) - Main board and gateware have been mostly functional for a while,
mechanical design and manufacturing for the case/mechatronics are progressing
slowly. If you have the skills and would like to help out, email sb at m-labs.hk
 or the mailing list.
